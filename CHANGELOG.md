# Changelog

## 2026-05-05

- Switched the desktop shell plan from Tauri to Neutralinojs to avoid the Visual Studio Build Tools requirement.
- Added Neutralino configuration, native allow-list, app icon, and tray icon assets.
- Reworked project scripts and documentation around `neu run`, `neu build`, and browser preview checks.
- Added a Neutralino CLI runner that uses the available Node 16 runtime when the default Node 14 runtime is too old.
- Fixed Neutralino icon path configuration so packaging resolves the app icon from the project directory.
- Initialized NuiPet as a private-first Tauri desktop pet project.
- Added a transparent always-on-top pet window with sprite animation, custom context menu, tray actions, and persisted settings.
- Added 鹿弈Nui sprite assets and metadata with a reserved-rights asset licensing boundary.
- Added asset validation notes and corrected the license asset boundary wording.
